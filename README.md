# 🏏 IPL Cricket Data Analysis Project

## 📂 About the Project
This project provides a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) of IPL cricket data from 2007 to 2024.  
We focus on uncovering player & team performances, venue insights, and match outcome patterns using ball-by-ball and match datasets.
